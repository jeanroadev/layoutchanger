2. Check the current keyboard layout.
3. Toggle to the opposite layout.
4. Display a notification message confirming the layout change, showing the newly activated layout.

## Usage

2. A notification will appear on the screen informing you about the layout change, specifying the new layout that has been activated.

## Requirements

- Bash scripting environment

## Installation
